# sprout-wrap

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap)

This project uses [soloist](https://github.com/mkocher/soloist) and [librarian-chef](https://github.com/applicationsonline/librarian-chef)
to run a subset of the recipes in sprout's [cookbooks]((https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout).

[Fork it](https://github.com/pivotal-sprout/sprout-wrap/fork) to 
customize its [attributes](http://docs.opscode.com/chef_overview_attributes.html) in [soloistrc](/soloistrc) and the list of recipes 
you'd like to use for your team. You may also want to add other cookbooks to its [Cheffile](/Cheffile), perhaps one 
of the many [community cookbooks](http://community.opscode.com/cookbooks). By default it configures an OS X 
Mountain Lion workstation for Ruby development.

Finally, if you've never used Chef before - we highly recommend you buy &amp; watch [this excellent 17 minute screencast](http://railscasts.com/episodes/339-chef-solo-basics) by Ryan Bates.
